## Game Description

Cuscuta is a biopunk rougelike dungeon-crawler, with emphasis on stealth mechanics and intuitive world generation


## Advanced Topic Description

### Networked Multiplayer

 + Multiplayer will function using a P2P connection between the two players
 + Each player has a unique carnage bar allowing for more build combinations
 + Procedural rooms are generated based off an average of both players' carnage bars, weighted heavier towards carnage
 + Teammates must balance between stealth and destruction to maintain a balance in the dangerous dungeon
 + Dungeons will be harder in co-op mode and therefore require strategy and planning


    
### Procedural Generation
+ Room size: Room size is variable and will increase/decrease depending on the carnage bar
+ Enemies: Enemy count and type is variable based on the carnage bar
+ Obstacles: Obstacles & stealth objects will spawn differently depending on the carnage bar
+ Replayable - Each playthrough is entirely procedurally generated, making it feel like a new run each time
+ Variable - Automatic balancing between 1-2 players, 2 player runs will have more enemies/difficulty
	##### Method
	1. Create (numRooms) rooms with different shapes
	2. Push the rooms apart until they are not touching
	3. Determine "main" rooms (boss rooms, starting room)
	4. Delauney triangulate the main rooms
	5. Create a MST from the graph to create edges and loops
	6. Add hallways

## Midterm Goals
* Playable Demo
	+ at least 1 enemy type with basic movement (basic, non-player oriented) and causes damage when colliding with a player
	+ 2D movement - Up, down, left, right
	+ Crouch/sneak mechanic, dash mechanic implemented
 	+ Carnage bar implemented - reacts to player gameplay and changes state depending on stealth or carnage 
* Generation
	+ Basic dungeon generation - fluctuating room size & metrics, completely random dungeon generation
	+ Entire dungeon generation at runtime
* Rudimentary Multiplayer
	+ Basic two-player connection - Not lag free, just able to have 2 players in same game
* Rudimentary Animation/Artwork
   	* Starter sword art
	* Character art & animations
	* Carnage Bar art & animations
   	* 2 enemy sprites & animations   	
* Basic Line-of-Sight Detection for 1 enemy type
  	+ move enemy to player's last known location (LKL)

## Final Goals
*  Complete Game
	+ Dungeon generation based on players' carnage bars and location - Should be random, but influenced by carnage bars and player count
		+ Too high carnage will generate rooms with difficult opponents to fight, but easy to sneak around
		+ Too low carnage will generate rooms with easier enemies to fight, but too many to sneak around
	+ Tight interplay between generation & multiplayer - 2 players mean more difficult rooms
 		+ More enemies will be spawned in with 2 players
		+ Some rooms require teamwork to complete
	+ At least 4 enemy types
		+ 2 For each category: strong in stealth vs strong in carnage
		+ Stealth:
			+ 1 Enemy that is weak, but can detect player from a longer radius
			+ 1 Enemy that has the longest detection radius and long memory
		+ Carnage:
			+ 1 Enemy that is weak, but is mobile and does high damage
			+ 1 Enemy with a high health bar and does high damage, but is very slow
 	+ One distinct item players can utilize
   	+ Ability to escape detection from enemies
* Finalized Generation
	+ Each room is generated realtime based on the carnage bar
	+ Rooms generated as you step into them, not all at the beginning of the game
	+ Enemy count & type fluctuates as they spawn real-time
	+ Dungeon "fights against" you
*  Fluid Multiplayer
	+ Movement and monsters must be synchronized 
	+ No large room lag
	+ Movement must be relatively lag-free
*  Ending
	+  End reward

## Stretch Goals

* Advanced Stealth/Detection System
	+ Ability to distract enemy
	+ Enemies pathfind to player's last known location
* At least 3 distinct items player can utilize (At least 2 weapons, 1 buff)
	+ Starter sword, gun, bow, knife, potions/powerup, etc

## Grade Breakdown

* Dungeon procedural generation works as intended: 20%
	* When carnage > stealth, enemies strong in stealth will spawn at an increased rate
	* When stealth > carnage, enemies strong in carnage will spawn at an increased rate 
	* when carnage > stealth, dungeons will generate with more opportunities to utilize stealth over carnage (ex. stronger enemies that can be avoided with stealth)
	* When stealth > carnage, dungeons wilsl generate with more opporunties to utilize carnage over stealth (ex. weaker enemies that you can't avoid being detected by)
	* Completely Random generation -- rooms from start to final boss
* Multiplayer P2P connection works as intended: 20%
	* Basic functionality: 2 players with full functionality in same lobby: 10%
	* Lack of major lag/latency in basic game functions: 10%
* Fluid movement mechanics (Walk, Sprint, Roll) -> can be used in succession: 10%
* Enemy A.I functionality -> Last Known Location, Player tracking, combat abilities: 15%
* Basic detection escape: 15%
	* Enemies have line of sight detection
	* Enemies lose interest after a set amount of time of player not being in line of sight
* Minimum Viable Product (all goals reached) 10%
* Stretch goals: 10%
	* Adv detection
 	* 3 distinct items
